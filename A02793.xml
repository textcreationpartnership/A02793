            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But afterward, when <hi>Paule</hi> ſawe that ſome of them did confirme them ſelues in ſuperſtition, and required Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as neceſſarie vnto ſaluation: then he cried out againſt them, and openlie condemned them, and when he ſawe that ſome falſe brethren came to ſpie his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.3.

                  <p>So alſo among the Gentiles, <hi>Paule</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Gentile. But howe? Not in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Idolatrie, but in obeying their ciuill Lawes, &amp; pollitique cuſtomes, and in agréeing to all their déedes, which were not repugnaunt to the word of God.

                  <p>But what ſhall we ſaye to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 3.2.</note> He ſtole to our Sauiour Chriſte in the night, he durſt not confeſſe him openlie in the daye: was he therefore condemned, becauſe he durſte not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with his mouth, confeſſe the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?

He declared him ſelfe, with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramathia,</hi> to be one of his Diſciples, when all his Diſciples had forſaken him: he made then a publique confeſſion with the greateſt daunger that might be, and when there was more occaſion to feare, then euer there was: then they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the body of <hi>Pilate</hi> to burie it, and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> bought Myrhe and Aloes ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, about an hundred pounde, and wrapped the body of Ieſus in Linnen and ſwéete Odours, to burie it.</p>
                  <p>And thus ye ſee, good Brethren, that theſe exſamples, doo nothing ſerue to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and cloake the infirmitie of our fleſh, howſoeuer they ſéeme at the firſt, to make ſome thing for vs yet, if we examine them thorowlie, they are vtterlie againſt vs.</p>

Then is he glad, that he hath founde ſuch a one as he woulde haue, and he accoumpteth him the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt, and the wiſeſt man in the world. But what commeth héereof in the ende? when the matter is come to be tried, the ſentence of iudgement is giuen, not by the

                  <p>Euen ſo it fareth with this corrupte fleſh of ours, in matters of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

                  <p>Let vs take héede then, that we doo not cloake or couer our ſinnes with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sirian:</hi> of <hi>Paule,</hi> or of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> béeing wraſted againſt the trueth: but let vs ſée what is euidentlie and plainly commaunded vs by the woord of God, and there we ſhall finde that a liuelie faith and open confeſſion, are vnſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable in a true Chriſtian.</p>

                  <p>Héereby then is condemned the polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of many, whiche in Religion, haue not ſo much reſpecte vnto the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of GOD, as to their owne priuate gaine, which care not how God be ſerued,
<pb facs="tcp:12877:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo that they maye liue in wealth and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, which would goe euerie Sunday in the yéere to a Communion, if they might gaine a halpeny by it: and euerie Sunday to a Maſſe, to gaine a penny by it, and for two pence, reſort to neither of them bothe.</p>
                  <p>Of which Religion, a certaine Atheiſt did councell his fréend to be, when he bade him to be alwayes of the Princes Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a man ſtanding vnder an olde trée, not to néere the trée, leaſt the trée ſhould fall vpon him: and againe, not too farre off, for then he could gather no fruite.</p>
                  <p>As many in theſe our dayes, that they may reape ſome commoditie, that they may be Iuſtices, and Sherifes, and beare a countenaunce in the worlde, they will pretende ſome forwardneſſe in Religion, but they are afeard of béeing too zealous, they will not ſtande too néere the trée, for feare leaſt the trée fall vpon them.</p>
                  <p>An other ſort of men are of a contrarie pollicie. They will alwayes be of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion contrarie to their Prince: in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> tyme, they were Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauntes, and nowe they are Papiſtes, that by this meanes they maye not onely
<pb facs="tcp:12877:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſéeme vnto the worlde, to be holie, deuout, and ſingular men: but alſo if any chaunge ſhould come (which God forbidde) they might happily héereafter liue of the ſpoyle of theyr Brethren, and ſo come to ſome preferment and Promotion. Theſe maye well bee compared to <hi>Gedeons</hi> Fléece, which,<note place="margin">Iud. 6.37.</note> when the grounde was wette, it was drie, and when the ground was drie, it was wette.</p>
                  <p>So theſe men, when they are among Proteſtauntes, they are Papiſtes, and when they are among Papiſtes, they are Proteſtauntes: and thus they ſéeke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be ſinguler, when in déede they are wurſe then nothing, I ſay wurſe then nothing before God.</p>
                  <p>Others there are, which are of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pollicie, they will alwayes be of the ſame Religion, with the companie wherein they are preſent. As I haue heard of a certayne Aſtronomer, which on a tyme to deceyue the eyes of the ſimple people, walked vppe and downe in the Stréetes, looking vppe into the Skyes, as though hee were ſome lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and profounde Doctour: when one aſked him what weather it ſhould be, he
<pb facs="tcp:12877:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſayde, fowle weather: when an other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him in the nexte ſtréete, he aunſwered, fayre weather. On the next day, when the weather prooued in deede to be fowle, then came he to him, to whome he had foretold that it ſhould be fayre, and ſayd: Maiſter Doctor, you were deceyued yeſterday, you ſayd it ſhould be fayre weather, and nowe it prooueth contrarie. The Aſtronomer aunſwered, Oh I did but ieſt with you, but aſke what I ſayde to ſuch a man, in ſuch a ſtréete.</p>
                  <p>Euen ſo, theſe pollitique Religious men keepe alwayes two tongues in their heades, that which goeth againſt them, that is in ieſt, and that which bringeth any profite to them, that is in earneſt. Theſe are like their graundfather the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.14</note> which to deceyue an other, can turne them ſelues into Angelles of lyght.</p>
                  <p>When they come into any daunger, then will they ſaye, we are conformable men, we come to the Church, we receyue the Sacrament, we obſerue our Princes Lawes, we obeye Iniunctions, we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe orders, we are as good Subiectes as any can be. But if they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſte theyr fellowes, and others of
<pb facs="tcp:12877:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> their owne crew. Then they ſtomacke and ſkorne at the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, they gybe and ſcoffe at the dooinges of the godlie and learned, they whiſper of ſtraunge newes, and gape for theyr golden daye, they deride and mocke the ſimpler ſorte of the profeſſours of Gods woorde, they defend and maintayne their groſſe errors, and ſuperſtitious opinions, they crie the Popes day againe in euerie corner.</p>
                  <p>Theſe maye peraduenture deceyue the eyes of men, but God is not deceyued with any Sophiſtrie. Theſe are lyke <hi>Camaelions,</hi> which can turne them ſelues into euerie cullour, ſauing white, and be all thinges, but what they ſhoulde be.</p>
